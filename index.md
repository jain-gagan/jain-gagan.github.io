Hey! I'm Gagan Jain, and I currently work as a Predoctoral Researcher at [Google Research India](https://research.google/teams/india-research-lab/) under the guidance of [Dr. Sujoy Paul](https://sujoyp.github.io/), [Dr. Arun Sai Suggula](https://research.google/people/arun-sai-suggala/) and [Dr. Prateek Jain](https://www.prateekjain.org/). My current work spans multiple independent active areas of research, including - Efficient Vision Models, Collaborative Bandit Algorithms, and Distributionally Robust ML Optimization
Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree from [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in), where I was advised by Prof. [Amit Sethi](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/). I also worked as a Data & Applied Scientist for an year at [Microsoft India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/).
